# web_dev_prj
This was my first ever web dev project....
so it may not appear to be that great....
but it worked great for me and helped me gain more knowledge and....
improved my overall skills as a programmer.
....And btw i used xampp localhost for hosting...so it may appear messy without that... and also this is just a prototype...and not a final result...

!!May be I further Develop this in FUTURE!!!
